## Examples for QML-AR

1. `00_chest`: This project renders a Chest and a cuboid using qml-ar.
The cuboid will be at (0, 0) and the chest at (210, 297).
The default camera on Desktop is "1" (second), and front on Android.
Note that you need to print the `ar_demo_sheet.pdf` on A4

2. `01_simplest`: This project renders a cube at (0, 0, 0) using qml-ar.
3. `02_image`: This project renders a cube at (0, 0, 0) using qml-ar. Image input is used instead of a camera.
4. `03_avr`: This project renders a cube at (0, 0, 0) using qml-ar. The Augmented Virtual Reality (or Mixed Reality) is enabled.
5. `04_clicked`: This project renders a cube at (0, 0, 0) using qml-ar. Moreover, it allows to estimate the clicked point x, y in the world.
6. `05_markers`: This project renders a cube at (0, 0, 0) using qml-ar. Moreover, it show how to react on markers dissapearance with a message to the user.
7. `06_mvp`: This project renders a cube at (0, 0, 0) using qml-ar. Moreover, it show how to obtain the raw MVP matrix from AR lib.
8. `07_property_setting`: This project shows how to manage properties of your the 3D scene by dynamically changing the cube position.
9. `08_pause`: This project shows how to pause and restart QMLAR
10. `09_cam0`: This project shows how to use camera 0 for AR
11. `10_blackplane`: This project shows a big black plane in place of marker sheet to test performance with big objects on Android
12. `11_draw`: Draw spheres on the scene with your finger
13. `12_orange`: This project renders a Chest and a cuboid using qml-ar, using ORANGE sheet
14. `13_vectors`: Draw vectors and move them on a virtual canvas
14. `13_pose`: The project shows the pose of the device w.r.t. the markers.
14. `98_test_image`: This project is similar to `02_image`, but it exits right after it can detect markers. Useful for testing the library after installation.
15. `99_cpp_only`: This project shows how to use QML-AR w/o QML (using only Qt GUI).
16. `97_detect_dots`: This project prints the list of detected dots
